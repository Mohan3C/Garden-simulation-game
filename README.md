**Garden Simulator: A Text-Based Game**

*Garden Simulator* is an immersive, text-based simulation game where players take on the role of a gardener, tasked with creating and nurturing a flourishing garden. The game challenges players to manage various aspects of gardening, including planting, watering, harvesting, and expanding their garden, all while navigating through seasons, weather patterns, and resource management.

**Gameplay Overview:**
The game unfolds entirely through text, with players making decisions by typing commands in response to descriptive prompts. Each decision can impact the growth and health of plants, the overall layout of the garden, and the player's resources. As the gardener, players begin with a small plot of land and a limited budget. Over time, they can plant a variety of flowers, vegetables, trees, and shrubs, each requiring different care and attention.

Key features include:
- **Planting and Growth:** Choose from a wide range of plants and flowers, each with specific growth patterns and needs. Plants may thrive or wither depending on how well the player maintains them.
- **Weather & Seasons:** The game features dynamic weather systems and seasonal changes that can affect plant growth. For instance, certain plants may only bloom in the spring, while others need to be protected during the winter months.
- **Resource Management:** Players must carefully balance their available resources, including water, fertilizer, and tools, to keep their garden thriving. Budget management is key to ensuring a successful harvest.
- **Upgrades and Customization:** As players progress, they can earn money or points to upgrade their garden with better tools, new plant varieties, and aesthetic decorations, turning their small plot into a lush paradise.
- **Time Progression:** Time in the game moves forward in a simulated, day-by-day fashion. Players will experience the passage of time as they wait for plants to grow, bloom, or be ready for harvest.

**Core Experience:**
The charm of *Garden Simulator* lies in its slow-paced, meditative gameplay, where the joy comes from nurturing life and seeing the tangible results of oneâ€™s care. Players can choose to focus on creating the perfect flower garden, cultivating a vegetable farm, or crafting a serene landscape with trees and shrubs. The simple yet deep decision-making process offers a relaxing yet rewarding experience.
